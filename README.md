<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Ricardo Ruiz</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate business analyst and data scientist from Honduras!</h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **strengthening my data science foundation — working through real-world problems in business analytics and preparing projects for my portfolio. I am also currently exploring Kaggle datasets and real-world business case studies.**

- 🌱 I’m currently reinforcing **core concepts in Python, SQL, and machine learning, and diving deeper into how to implement these with real-world data. I'm especially focused on building intuition for model selection, evaluation, and eventually scaling into applied AI systems.**

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **Data science projects that solve real problems — especially in business analytics, financial modeling, operations research, consumer/user behavior, etc.**

- 🤝 I’m looking for help with **contributing to real-world data projects where I can both add value and continue growing. I’m seeking opportunities—internships, open-source work, or collaborations—where I can apply my current skills, receive feedback from experienced professionals, and get closer to production-level data science. I am always open to learning while pulling my weight.**

- ⚡ Fun fact **I’m into history, philosophy, business strategy, and emerging tech — always down to chat about how empires, ideologies, technology, and markets shaped the modern world.**
